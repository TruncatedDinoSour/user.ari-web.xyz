Hello, this the comment and opinion
section of my website,
I didn't want to put it into every page
so I extracted this into its seperate
domain so everyone who wants can use this
and who doesn't, why should they download
useless bloat on every page load?

And either way, some sites of mine (Like my blog)
have JavaScript disabled so lol

BTW, source code: git
```
